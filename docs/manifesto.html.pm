◊cyan{Reliability is a problem of expression. The right language changes what's possible by bridging operational, cultural, and technical boundaries.}

◊h4{Philosophy}

◊cyan{(1)} ◊pink{Codify Success First} Without a measure, success is undecidable. If an expectation isn't formal enough to be verified, it isn't an expectation, it's hope. Express it once, formally. Let everything else follow. The boundary of your expression is the boundary of your reliability.

◊cyan{(2)} ◊pink{Mientras Uno Está Vivo, Uno Debe Amar Lo Más Que Pueda} Life is finite. Build software you're proud of: software that respects the people who depend on it. Love is a constraint. It shapes what you ship, what you refuse to ship, and the harm you will not externalize.

◊cyan{(3)} ◊pink{Flourish in Symbiosis} No software exists in isolation. Healthy ecosystems are mutualistic: every participant both gives and receives. Extraction is a short-term strategy. Symbiosis is a long-term one. Default to leaving the ecosystem better than you found it.
